hello anonymous model, I need your help in creating a workshop plan and code.
this is a braindump so my ideas might seem fragmented but here goes:
I'm an experienced engineer with some AI/LLM knowledge under my belt, I want to share my experience and knowledge with my techies in my hometown, the technical cieling there is low and I really want to help the community and build capacity for the betterment of the whole society.
I will probably be holding two sessions, each one is 2 hours long, I would like to cover the basics assuming the techies dont have experience with AI/LLM.
The sessions need to be hands on, you and me will create an open source repo on github where we'll host everything related to the workshops including code/infra/docs whatever is needed to help others build useful skills.

this will targeted at engineers in Jordan so their English language is not native but they have no problem with english oriented sessions.

give me your thoughts and ideas before we start implementing anything, also ask me for whatever info you need to get a full picture



1. Participant Background:
the Jordanian market is mostly PHP, .NET and some python here and there
2. Technical Environment
they will bring their laptops and I will be sharing my screen during the whole thing, assume a stable and strong internet connection.
No restrictions for APIs use
I use Cursor almost exclusively and I'd target VS Code.
3. Learning Outcomes;
Making calls to API while tuning params like Temperature and TopK, a simple RAG implementation (local files probably)
Do you have other suggestions regarding the outcomes? I'm open to ideas
4. Local Context:
The Jordanian market is a virgin AI market for sure, I believe RAGs would add immediate value to almost everyone.
5. Timeline:
it is now the 18th of October, I want to hold a session before mid November and another in early January. I got a local jordanian company who will provide the venue and all the marketing support, I only have to focus on the technical part


I have also added two current AI projects I'm working on, they are in docs/references/ they will give you an idea of my tech stack, lets try to use that tech as I dont have much time to learn something new for this workshop.

tell me what you plan on doing before you proceed and thank you my love <3
