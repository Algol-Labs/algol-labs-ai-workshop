# Algol Labs AI Workshop - Jordan

**Hands-on AI/LLM Workshop for Jordanian Engineers**

This repository contains all materials for a two-session AI/LLM workshop designed for engineers in Jordan who want to learn practical AI skills. The workshop assumes no prior AI experience and focuses on building useful, immediately applicable knowledge.

## Workshop Overview

### Target Audience
- Engineers with PHP, .NET, or Python experience
- No prior AI/LLM knowledge required
- Comfortable with basic programming concepts

### Sessions Structure
- **Session 1 (2 hours):** AI/LLM Fundamentals - API calls and parameter tuning
- **Session 2 (2 hours):** RAG Implementation - Building practical AI applications

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of both sessions, participants will be able to:
- Make API calls to LLMs with proper parameter tuning
- Understand temperature, topK, and other key parameters
- Implement simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Build basic AI-powered applications
